# FilesystemTreeHTML


This is a project that will eventually contain filesystem trees in the form of filetree structure with tooltips as to what different files do and what kind of information they store. This with a digital investigators interest in mind.

I am going to add tags manually once I found the correct layout for the page. These tags will make the files searchable. Every file with a matching tag will be highlighted by a change of background. Hovering over the files will give ypu more information on what you may expect to find
