# FilesystemTreeHTML


This is a project that will eventually contain filesystem trees in the form of HTML with tooltips as to what different files do.

A future improvement would be to add tags to each file, meaning that you can search for a file that deals with Registry entries and the <details> would open up on all the files containing that tag (preferably also hightlight it with color).
